<h1>Caravana</h1>
<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>
Caravan is played with two players building three opposing piles (or "caravans") of numbered cards. The goal is to outbid your opponent's caravan with the highest value of numbered cards without being too light (under 21) or overburdened (over 26).
</p>

<p>
The game begins with each player taking eight cards from their deck and placing either one numerical card or ace on each caravan. Players may not discard during this initial round.
</p>

<p>
Once both players have started their three caravans, each player may do <em>one</em> of the following on their turn:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Play one card and draw a new card from his or her deck to their hand</li>
<li>Discard one card from their hand and draw a new card from his or her deck</li>
<li>Discard one of their caravans by removing all cards from that pile</li>
</ul>
    
<p>
Caravans have a direction, either ascending or descending numerically, and a suit. The suit is determined with the first card placed on a caravan, the direction by the second. All subsequent cards must continue the numerical direction or match the suit of the previous card. Cards of the same numerical value cannot be played in sequence, regardless of suit. Face cards can be attached to numeric cards in any caravan and will affect them in various ways.
